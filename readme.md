## Umbraco ContentService Tutorial ##

This repository contains the Visual Studio project and an Umbraco 6 website that compliment the tutorial around using the ContentService to import a CSV file into Umbraco Documents (nodes).

The easiest way to run the sample website, is simply by opening it up in Microsoft WebMatrix and run it. As it's using a SQL CE database that's all you need to do.

Enjoy!
